This is the first chapter of the \gls{thesis}.~\cite{Aaboud:2016mmw,Bruning:782076}

 \caption{This is a placeholder figure to act as an example.
  Here we cite a new reference in the caption to demonstrate that given the package configuration our order of references will not be distributed by the table of contents.~\cite{Higgs:1964ia}}\label{fig:test_figure}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:subfigure_example}, the subfigures are independent of each other such that Figure~\ref{fig:subfigure_1} and Figure~\ref{fig:subfigure_2} can be accessed separately.
